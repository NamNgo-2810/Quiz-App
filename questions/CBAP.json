    "question": "A national branch of a global company is struggling to improve business processes of its Public and Government Affairs (PGA) department. To work with external stakeholders effectively, PGA employees need to collect, manage, and exchange a vast amount of information. Complex cases involve collaboration of many employees from different departments. The ability to share information and to coordinate corresponding activities is crucial for the company's growth plans. Their current tools and practices do not serve the purpose well. The existing system, which was deployed a couple of years ago, has only a few active users. The majority of PGA employees avoid using it because the system is hard to use and lacks needed functionality. Consequently, available information is mostly unstructured and stored either locally or on a shared network drive. Some of the information exists only in a paper form. The branch's PGA head, who sponsors the project, wants to implement a configurable solution that two other branches successfully deployed several months ago. Both deployments were done by three solution consultants, who will be available to assist in the project. They will be responsible for tailoring the solution to PGA needs, as well as for training the PGA staff. With their help, the sponsor plans to complete the project in approximately three months. The solution consultants reside in another country 7 hours ahead of the rest of the project team. They will be available part-time, but are planning two one-week long trips to the PGA central office to conduct initial training and to participate in the final deployment of the system into production. The consultants, in turn, expect a business analyst (BA) to assist in collecting necessary data and defining customization requirements. The solution consultants have composed a spreadsheet with all requirements that are already implemented in the solution. The requirements in the catalog are organized partially by user tasks and partially by system features. The branch has distinct definitions of PGA user roles and uses a different approach to structuring requirements specifications. How should the BA organize the customization requirements?",

    "question": "A very large insurer of General Liability and Property Damage insurance has an upward trend of increased claims over the past 5 years. The Risk Control Area for that company has just completed a 12 month Pilot of a new improved Risk Control Site. The purpose of the site is to help their customers manage their exposures and ideally prevent them from having claims. There were 100 customers that were part of the Pilot that represented 25 different industries. The business goals were to increase use of the site and provide tools to help customer awareness of their exposures, so that they may reduce existing exposures and ultimately reduce claims. The sites Features were as follows: ✑ Improvements to the search engine to all customers to search for articles, tools and services on the site. ✑ A checklist function that allow customer to create their own unique Checklists or utilize a sample provided by ABC company to use daily, weekly etc for an area of their facility. ✑ A promotion feature \"\" where Risk preventing Articles, and tools on the site are marketed toward a customer. ✑ A profile section allowing for Customer Name, Address and contact Phone number. After the 12 months pilot, the business sponsor received an assessment of what was working and what was not. The Assessment of the pilot revealed overall site activity had significantly increased, however only 5% of the time the promotions were viewed. And the most shocking was that total claims increased by nearly 20% for these 100 customers during the pilot period. The business sponsor was perplexed as he had an expectation of reduced claims and at least for 30% viewing of promotions since the project team had spend a lot of careful time and effort on this feature. A BA was assigned to do further analysis regarding the low use of the promotions and why claims were not being reduced. Regarding the use of promotion the BA looked into other similar companies to see what they did differently to get their customer to look at their promotions. The BA found that similar companies had promotions that targeted the industry the customer was in so it was more relevant to them and they were more interested to view the promotion. In addition the BA sent out survey to all 100 pilot customers asking probing questions about what they thought of the site and if they felt it had decreased their exposure to risk sufficiently. The Survey responses came back with raving positive comments and providing examples of how the site had been helping in the reduction of claims from the customer's perspective. In addition the survey also revealed insight that the customers found the promotion often irrelevant to their industry. The BA asked for a dump of all documentation of the 100 claims that were filed over the 12 month pilot period. The BA found the nearly 90% of the claim field were all in one region of the country and were all for property damage related to several severe winter storms in the region and the claims were nearly all unavoidable by the customers. The BA brought all this analysis back to the business sponsor and made the recommendation to the business sponsor to require the customer to select 1 of 25 industries in their profile. This would in turn allow for the ability to show industry specific promotions and promote search results relative to a customer's industry to be stored at the top giving the customer a more personalized experience. What type of recommendation has the BA made to the business sponsor?",

The system tracks the location of the parcel by tracking the vehicle in which it is contained. However, for a group of old delivery trucks, it was noticed that the engine sound and vibration disturbed the tracking signal and caused interruptions. Therefore, the tracking does not perform accurately on these vehicles. Although the majority of management would like to sell these vehicles and replace them with newer ones, the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) was strongly against that approach. The CFO argued that instead of hanging tracking devices on the trucks' body, they can have the truck drivers manually send the truck location from a hand held mobile device every 30 minutes. The company has a total of 134 old delivery trucks that have been in service for 10 years. Each vehicle was bought at a price of $22,000. Depreciation is done using a straight line basis and it is estimated that the vehicle depreciates at $1000 per year. The estimated salvage value per vehicle is about $3,000. Another area of tactical improvement for the courier company is pricing. The management strongly believes that they can start a price war with the most aggressive competitor. Management thinks, with their variable cost of $4 per parcel and fixed cost of $6 per parcel, they can win the market. However, after implementing the tracking solution, fixed cost will jump to $8 per parcel which made management reconsider their options.

Each year the claims department is given a $3,5 million budget to spend. Time is of the essence since there are some regulatory changes that will be coming the following year that will require several features that currently neither one of the two claims systems currently support. There are eight stakeholders involved in this initiative. There are local to where the claim systems are managed, while five are located across the country. The business analyst (BA) struggled to get all stakeholders to agree on the desired features but ultimately got agreement on ten identified key features for the new claims systems. The BA was able to build a current state and future state process model which included all ten key features. System A processes 75% of the company's claims. It is 5 years old and the claim processors love it because it is easy to use. However it must go offline for two hours each day. The code is very modular so it does have flexibility to be modified. To upgrade system A to have all ten features it would cost %5 million. System A would be at capacity if it were to process all of the company's claims. System B processes 25% of the company's claims. It is an older mainframe system, but rarely goes offline. It could easily handle double the number of claims that system A processes.
